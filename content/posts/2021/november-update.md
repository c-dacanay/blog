November is passed already!

I don't understand how you can poo-poo folks for liking the fall. Did you see the trees this month? What's not to like? 

About a week after I wrote my previous blog post I accepted a job offer. I started as the UX Designer for One More Multiverse, a platform to play tabletop role playing games online. It's sort of a tool, sort of a game, but it is at such an appealing intersection of my interests that I couldn't say no. It's a very small team filled with friendly, committed and ambitious people. It's only been a little over a week, but I'm really pleased and excited. 

The leisure time I mentioned previously has dwindled and disappeared. Useful habits have been disrupted this month and it has been difficult for me to find my footing again. 

Emily and I decided to cap off our 100 days of writing with National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)--aka, even more writing. The stated goal of NaNoWriMo is to write a 50,000 word novel in one month. We had already been writing for months, so we set our goal to just complete our stories from beginning to end.

Creative exercises like this can feel like pushing yourself at the gym. But when something hurts, is it because you're challenging yourself, or are you hurting yourself? Last month I was not only writing thousands of words a day on my story, but drawing, imagining, and worldbuilding in every spare moment. Writing this month has felt like pulling teeth in comparison. 

It took the entire month, but I think I've found my footing again. I rarely feel proud of my own work, but I'm proud of not giving up on something I care about.

As the days get shorter I hope you're finding time to hibernate, and rest.
