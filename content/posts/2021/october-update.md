Hi there,

I'm writing this after several friends have asked "what are you doing, nowadays?", and I've always stumbled over myself trying to explain. I usually say something about having graduated from my master's program, that I'm a "research resident", and then make some anxious joke about not having a real job. 

This is all true, but it also doesn't convey the labor and the joy of the past few months. Here is the long answer.

The research residency at NYU's ITP program is a year long appointment where a hand full of graduates are kept on, part-time, to continue servicing the program. Residents can teach workshops, conduct office hours, or help sustain other student or faculty let projects. 

For me, it means that I spend my time at NYU split in thirds. 

Firstly, I project manage [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)--the friendliest machine learning tool on the web--which is an open source project near to my heart. As a team we think a lot about how to critically engage with machine learning in creative practice, sustainability in open source, and how we can model practices of transparency that we feel are missing from the tech world.

This month I [spoke on a panel at the CROSS Research Symposium](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2021-symposium/index.html) on behalf of the project. 

Secondly, I'm collaborating with two other residents and student workers to grow [the Design Lab](https://designlab.itp.io/) as a student resource. It is a place where students at any level of design training can get critique, guidance, and software help. Most recently, we "nested" the project in NYU's physical space by painting a part of the ITP floor a fantastic yellow.

Lastly, I have office hours spent talking with students about their projects, or problems. It has been a pleasure to impart whatever perspective I've gained in the past two years. 

There are busy and light weeks, but since mid-September I've kept at least two days a week for myself at home.

When you have worked a 9-5 your entire adult life it can be difficult to know what to do with excess time. I spent a lot of it in the early months feeling guilty, anxious, not knowing how to "make the most of it" (aka, be productive). Practice helped with this.

I have been writing every morning, for about an hour, for 60 days now. Crucially, I am doing this with a friend--we have been celebrating and complaining through the whole process together. On days where I feel like a lump, at least we wrote! On other days it is invigorating in a way that's difficult to describe.

I'm writing a story that's been rolling around my head for a number of years. The process of extracting the idea from imagination is, as most of you know, a struggle. To aid in my writing I've made a city, with an in-universe travel guide. I'm drawing space ships for my own reference. I'm (sort of) learning about forensic anthropology. It has been so much fun. 

Practice, and the confidence it instills, is another reason I wanted to start writing publicly. I've always been bad at talking about my work, but I'm ready to practice sharing things I care about. Posting to the world feels bad, but I can at least write to the people I care about (and if you are reading this, that's probably you).

So thank you for reading.
